            <h2> About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello, I'm a passionate front end developer.
                I'm thrilled to welcome you to my corner of the internet. <br/>

                In 2020, i began my journey into web development during my undergraduate studies. 
                I realized the importance of forging a unique path, considering my diverse academic background.
                Driven by unwavering commitment, I dove into coding, consistently honing my skills and pushing my boundaries. <br/> <br/>

                I'm currently pursuing Masters in Computer Applications from Amity University Online. <br/>
                Today my mission extends beyond merely securing a job. I aim not just to expand my knowledge 
                but to excel in both my professional and personal life. <br/>
                It's not just about coding, its about crafting a fulfilling and balanced lifestyle. <br/> <br/>

                On a side note, I'm a foodie, a musoc lover, a blogger, and a fitness enthusiast.
